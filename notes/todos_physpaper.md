# Notes on the physics paper (Jan. 22)

## Main messages
- Extension of the lattice approach to channel geometry and to situations where there is a fluid flow. This includes a clear description of interactions with obstacles and of the modelling of the effects of the fluid flow in terms of rates.
- Characterization of the different phases, depending on alignment sensitivity $g$ and on the flow velocity $v_1/v_0$. (Mainly Fig. 6 left of December notes.) Possibly introducing new order parameters or measurements (flux, density).
- Relevance of a lattice approach and of a dynamics in terms of rates in order to describe actual swimmers? (Dependence on resolution, possible comparisons with particle approaches.) Time averages vs. averages over events.
- Effect of periodicty on approximating an infinite channel with periodic boundary conditions. This could be a way to convey the message that the organization in bands observed for active systems is often a consequence of periodicity. Interpretation in terms of correlation lengths and time of convergence to a statistical steady state.

## TODOs

- Perform longer statistics, in particular in situations where periodic boundary conditions determine the steady state (e.g., bands). -> Check whether we should wait for the new version of the code, depending on the improvement in speed.
- Check dependence upon resolution and box aspect ratio. -> wait, same as above.
- Is there any information that can be obtained from Lagrangian statistics (following particles)? -> CC & JB think
- Understand correlation lengths and times and their behaviors as a function of the domain size $L_x$ in the periodic direction. And time of covergence to the steady state (different realizations?). Which observables? -> CC
- Write a particle version? (with steric forces, angular diffusion, and Vicsek interactions) -> JB

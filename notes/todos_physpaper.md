# Notes on the physics paper (Jan. 22)

## Main messages
- Extension of the lattice approach to channel geometry and to situations where there is a fluid flow. This includes a clear description of interactions with obstacles and of the modelling of the effects of the fluid flow in terms of rates.
- Characterization of the different phases, depending on alignment sensitivity $g$ and on the flow velocity $v_1/v_0$. (Mainly Fig. 6 left of December notes.) Possibly introducing new order parameters or measurements (flux, density).
- Relevance of a lattice approach and of a dynamics in terms of rates in order to describe actual swimmers? (Dependence on resolution, possible comparisons with particle approaches.) Time averages vs. averages over events. CC:(the state change of the lattice is a discrete event but the dynamics is defined in continuous-time (this is what the Gillespie algorithm does; it simulates a continuous-time markov process). Thus, I think we should work with time-averages. In order to justify dynamics in terms of rates, we should understand why the Gillespie algorithm works in generating statistically correct trajectories (possible solutions) of a stochastic equation system.)
- Effect of periodicty on approximating an infinite channel with periodic boundary conditions. This could be a way to convey the message that the organization in bands observed for active systems is often a consequence of periodicity. Interpretation in terms of correlation lengths and time of convergence to a statistical steady state. CC:(To study the correlation function discussed in the Cavagna 2016 paper, I understood that we should calculate C(k) also for k->0, which means to consider a very large channel (infinite), even though the particle dynamics evolve only in the periodic subdomain. Then we know that when the correlation length reaches the domain size (due to the periodicity), we have reached the convergence time. 
Anyway, the point is that we are interested in finding the so-called 'time-to-convergence' in order to do proper statistics. Should we not directly study the behavior of the order parameter in time? And then say that if we stabilize the order parameter, then we are in a stable/converged configuration? Then if m ==1 we know it is an artifact of the periodic b.c.)

## TODOs

- Perform longer statistics, in particular in situations where periodic boundary conditions determine the steady state (e.g., bands). -> Check whether we should wait for the new version of the code, depending on the improvement in speed.
- Check dependence upon resolution and box aspect ratio. -> wait, same as above.
- Is there any information that can be obtained from Lagrangian statistics (following particles)? -> CC & JB think
- Understand correlation lengths and times and their behaviors as a function of the domain size $L_x$ in the periodic direction. And time of covergence to the steady state (different realizations?). Which observables? -> CC
- Write a particle version? (with steric forces, angular diffusion, and Vicsek interactions) -> JB
